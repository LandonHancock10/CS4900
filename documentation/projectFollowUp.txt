Project Followup
PROJECT: Sprint 4
Name: Landon Hancock (10869188)
Date: 04-22-2025
Status: Green Light

What did I do?

Deployed the frontend using AWS S3 with custom domain setup

Connected the frontend to an Express backend deployed through AWS Lambda + API Gateway

Built out core CRM features including customer record creation, user assignment, and data retrieval from DynamoDB

Implemented basic authentication flow and session storage

Added UI for profile picture uploads and integrated S3 storage for images

Worked on normalizing assigned user data and rendering it properly on the frontend


What problems did I run into?

Setting up profile picture uploads was more complex than expected due to formatting, permissions, and S3 policy requirements

Ran into multiple CORS issues between frontend and backend before finalizing headers and routes

Struggled with mobile responsiveness and layout bugs across devices

Unexpected AWS charges from CloudFront before I disabled it manually

File structure and folder organization got messy and had to be restructured for maintainability


What I plan on working on next:

Polish mobile layout and responsive design

Improve error handling and input validation

Prepare documentation and walkthrough for project presentation

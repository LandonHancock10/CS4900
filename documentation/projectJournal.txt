# WebSpark CRM Development Journal - Updated

I started this project to build a simple, easy-to-use customer relationship management (CRM) system, inspired by Discord's layout but designed for businesses. At first, I explored different tech stacks to figure out the best tools to use. After testing a few options, I decided on AWS, using DynamoDB for the database, S3 for hosting the frontend, and API Gateway with Lambda to handle API requests.

Once I picked the tech stack, I set up a Git repository with automatic deployment to S3. This made it easy to update the siteâ€”every change I pushed to the main branch would automatically go live.

For the frontend, I chose Vue.js because it's lightweight and flexible. On the backend, I built the API using Express.js and connected it to DynamoDB. This setup ensures that the CRM runs smoothly without needing a traditional server.

One of the first big features I added was authentication. I created a login and signup system, storing user data in a Users table in DynamoDB. This made it possible for users to securely sign up and log in.

## Recent Progress: Customer Management Features

I've significantly expanded the customer management capabilities with a more robust data model and improved UI:

### Enhanced Customer Data Structure
- Created a streamlined customer schema that stores essential contact information
- Implemented a flexible tab-based system to organize different types of customer data
- Added support for notes and tasks associated with each customer
- Set up the foundation for team collaboration by allowing users to be assigned to customers

### Improved User Interface
- Developed a Discord-inspired sidebar for quick access to customer records
- Created a vertical tab navigation system for easy switching between information types
- Added a task management interface where users can create, mark complete, and delete tasks
- Implemented proper form validation and error handling for customer data entry
- Added visual cues for active selections and data state

### Backend API Enhancements
- Built dedicated endpoints for retrieving individual customer records
- Created specialized endpoints for updating different aspects of customer data
- Added proper error handling and validation for all customer operations
- Implemented customer deletion functionality with confirmation to prevent accidental data loss
- Set up CORS configurations to ensure smooth frontend-backend communication

### Technical Challenges Overcome
- Addressed payload size limitations when working with customer data
- Refined the DynamoDB access patterns to efficiently retrieve and update customer records
- Implemented proper state management to handle customer data mutations
- Optimized server.js and API Gateway configurations for better performance

Looking ahead, I plan to enhance the existing functionality with search capabilities and filtering options. I'll also add more sophisticated task tracking with due dates and reminders. The most exciting upcoming feature will be implementing a communication history system to track all customer interactions in one place, making this a truly comprehensive CRM solution.
